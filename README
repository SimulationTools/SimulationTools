NRMMA - Numerical Relativity in Mathematica
-------------------------------------------

by Ian Hinder and Barry Wardell

NRMMA (Numerical Relativity in MatheMaticA) is a Mathematica package
for the analysis of data in Numerical Relativity. It has mainly been
used for the analysis of data from the Einstein Toolkit Cactus code,
but it includes many components which are useful for general
data. Adding support for other codes is possible.

Please see https://bitbucket.org/ianhinder/nrmma/wiki/Home for
installation instructions and an introduction.
