SimulationTools
---------------

by Ian Hinder and Barry Wardell

SimulationTools is a free software package for the analysis of numerical
simulation data in Mathematica. It has mainly been used for the analysis of
data from Numerical Relativity simulations using the Einstein Toolkit Cactus
code, but it includes many components which are useful for general data.
Adding support for other codes is possible.

Please see http://simulationtools.org/ for installation instructions
and an introduction.
