Tasks for NRMMA package
=======================

HIGH PRIORITY:

LOW PRIORITY:

* Think about deleting old items from the Memo cache if the amount of
  memory used by the cache goes above a certain amount.

* Associate entries in the Memo cache with file names.  If the file is
  modified, the entry gets deleted from the cache because it is
  assumed to be invalid.

* Use PackedArrays in CarpetHDF5.  This should be faster and take up
  significantly less memory.  The down-side is that NaNs and None
  cannot be represented in these.

* Implement functions for doing surface and line integrals on
  DataRegions.

* Make it easy to generate the frames of a movie and then make the
  movie itself.  Would need to have a suitable program installed.
  Could support both ffmpeg and mencoder.

* Add contour and vector plots to DataRegion.
