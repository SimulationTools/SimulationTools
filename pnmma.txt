PNMMA
=====

A package for dealing with PN expressions in Mathematica.

Should this package have actual PN expressions, or is it just utility
functions?

How should PN expressions be organized?  Should we have a consistent
naming convention for them?

We probably want to set up some rules.

Do we want to work in terms of DataTable objects?

Maybe we should take the DataTable functionality out of nrmma and put
it into its own package, then both pnmma and nrmma can use it.  

What could we have an a pnmma package?

* Basic PN expressions taken out of papers

* New PN expressions derived from the basic expressions

* All the above as series

* Utilities for manipulating series

* A function to construct a waveform using certain modular inputs

* A function to match NR and PN, or at least an interface to such a thing

For the moment, we do everything in modified harmonic coordinates, so
in principle all the expressions should be compatible with each other.
Maybe we can just make up a single master package which contains PN
expressions?  Or maybe we should have a "circular" package, and an
"eccentric" package, not tied to any particular paper.  The circular
stuff would be mostly from Blanchet.
