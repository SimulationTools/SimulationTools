Many simulations involve the solution of partial differential equations using \
finite difference methods.  Several simulations, identical apart from the \
mesh spacing, are then compared to see how the numerical solution changes \
with the grid spacing.  This is done both to show that the solution converges \
to an exact solution, and to assess the numerical error.\
